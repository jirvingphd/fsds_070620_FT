For instance, in healthcare data, missing values in a `Weight` column may be using impossible values such as `0` or `9999`.  These are valid to the computer, since they are real-numbered, but are obvious to anyone analyzing the data as placeholder values.  \n",

In a normal distribution, three standard devations from the mean in both the directions cover 99.7% of the data, so any values outside this range are highly improbable, and can be safely discarded as outliers. \n",
